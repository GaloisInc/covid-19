# Galois' COVID-19 Staging Repository

# Objectives for the next week

* Stand up analysis pages for Ohio, Oregon, and Arizona
  * Include county-level/metropolitan analysis of resources and risk
  * Identify reliable sources of county-level data, and create transforms for aggregations on metropolitan level
  * Initial visualizations and education materials

* Can we build predictive models of best/worst case scenarios?  We have a lot of country 
and city level data of places where things are going badly, and where they aren't.
  * Can we build a classifier?
  * Can the classifier identify trajectory shifts?
  * Basins of attraction, with attractors for the trajectories?  Show interventions
and their impact?

* Can we project the likely time to hospital resource overrun for a metro area?
  * Can we suggest when a hospital will be over/under provisioned to allow sharing?
